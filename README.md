# Power BI Financial Dashboard (Profit Analysis)
This is a dashboard project developed using the Power BI sample dataset. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales, profits, and trends for a company, enabling detailed analysis of various aspects of the business.
I created this dashboard following a YouTube video with the purpose of studying Power BI. I think the result turned out well, so I decided to share it. This project is not original.
